# google-news

##Purpose
Simple application that calls news from a API via JavaScript.
It's responsive and includes a JS built search funtionality.

## Initial setup
`cd` into the project directory (where the grunt file is).
Run `npm install` to install the front end requirements, and then run grunt. `grunt` will output all the CSS & JS files into the `assets/dist` folder.

## Git
Please use branches accordingly. For all new changes, branch off of `master` and create your own feature branch for example `my-change`. Test your branch changes, and only when it is working, merge the branch into master.

## File structure
All the functionality is in `assets/js/request.js`. I've tried to add as many comments as possible to explain what I've built.

All the styling is in `css/sass` & this is pretty straight forward. There are a few mixin's in `mixin.scss` but other than that it's pretty basic.
